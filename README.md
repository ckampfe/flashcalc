flashcalc
=========

Flashcalc is a simple photographic flash calculator written in ruby. 

The idea is that given the guide number (GN) of your flash unit and the ISO setting of your camera/film, Flashcalc will be able to help you achieve proper flash exposure with your situation variables. For example, flashcalc could tell you the maximum distance between your flash unit and your subject where the picture will be properly exposed. It could also tell you the minimum necessary aperture (given as an f-number) to achieve a properly exposed picture.
